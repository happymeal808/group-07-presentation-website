Hey, welcome to our README. 😸
  
Our code represents the utilization of markdown as a whole.
Due to it's simplistic nature markdown is a scripting language that can be utilized to format HTML and text based applications.

## What is Markdown?

To put it plainly, Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format plaintext text documents. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber. Gruber's primary goal in his design was to create an unobtrusive and readable text formatter, even in it's source-code form. In comparison to HTML, Markdown should be thought of as a writing tool, and HTML as the publishing format.

## What does it do?

Markdown is an ecosystem of tools that lets you complete a variety of tasks like creating an HTML page, taking notes, writing a novel, or to even create a slide presentation. Utilizing markdown can lead to a higher efficiency in everyday tasks and the simplistic syntax makes markdown a efficient tool to quickly get your ideas down and implemented. Markdown's simplistic syntax and utilization makes it easy to learn and adapt to one's coding knowledge base. Markdown is a useful tool for any developer when it comes to formatting a README.md on Github, or to simply comment on a Reddit post.

## Why should you even use it?

## Where can you use it?

## Pros vs Cons

### Pros:

* Files containing markdown can be opened using any application, whereas say a Microsoft word document locks content to a proprietary file format.
* You can create markdown-formatted text with any operating system.
* It is future proof. Unlike PDFs or Word Documents, .md files are readable even when not properly rendered.

### Cons:

* Markdown is not standardized. There is no specification or authority for Markdown. Different implementations of Markdown may have different behaviors or interpretations of the syntax. This can lead to inconsistencies across dfferent platforms and tools.
* Due to it's minimalistic design, it is limited in it's functionality. It does not natively support footnotes, tables of content, citations, mathematical equations, charts, diagrams, and more. That being said, with a little bit of internet connection, it is possible to use links to utilize some of these features!
* Unlike most markup languages, Markdown lacks accessibilty features such as alt tags, classes, and id's, making it difficult for screen readers to properly interpret text.

## Code Demo

Here, let's go over some best practices of basic Markdown syntax:

### Headings

Note that the space between the '#' and the heading text is important!

| Markdown     | HTML |  Rendered  |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |  
| `# Heading 1 `   | `<h1>Heading</h1>`| # Heading 1  |  
| `## Heading 2 `   | `<h2>Heading</h2>`| ## Heading 2  | 
| `### Heading 3 `   | `<h3>Heading</h3>`| ### Heading 3  | 
| `#### Heading 4 `   | `<h4>Heading</h4>`| #### Heading 4 | 
| `##### Heading 5 `   | `<h5>Heading</h4>`| ##### Heading 5  | 
| `###### Heading 6 `   | `<h6>Heading</h6>`| ###### Heading 6  | 

### Paragraphs
Separate your paragraphs from one another by using a blank line between them.
| Markdown     | HTML |  Rendered  |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |  
|` Hey, check out this paragraph. So cool. `  | `<p>Hey, check out this paragraph.</p> <p>So cool.</p>`| Hey, check out this paragraph. So cool.  |  


### Emphasis

Bold and italics can be used on their own or together, and can even be placed within words.
| Markdown     | HTML |  Rendered  |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |  
| `This is how you **bold** text. `   | `This is how you <strong>bold</strong> text.`| TThis is how you **bold** text.  |  
| `This is how you *italisize* text. `   | `This is how you <em>italisize</em> text.`| This is how you *italisize* text  | 
| `Wow, this text is so ***emphatic***! `   | `Wow, this text is so <em><strong>emphatic</strong></em>!`| Wow, this text is so ***emphatic***! | 

### Blockquotes
| Markdown     |  Rendered  |  
| -----------  | ------ |  
| > This is how you make a blockquote.   | `> This is how you make a blockquote.`  |
